# brewery

I've been storing my beer recipes in a spreadsheet for years. I decided to put them in a little web app, mostly as an excuse to try out [Mavo](https://mavo.io).

The app is on GitHub Pages since it's just a static HTML file: https://codekitchen.github.io/brewery/

The app's data is stored in [a gist](https://gist.github.com/codekitchen/2ae0f1bc8508ed0a1f792cd229e42deb), supposedly if you log in to the app it will automatically fork the gist and from then on you can edit and treat it as your own. I haven't tried it out.
